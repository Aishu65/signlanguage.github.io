                <h1>History of Sign Language</h1><br><br>
                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the
                        earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in Plato's Cratylus,
                        where Socrates says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one
                        another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just
                        as dumb people do at present?" Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical
                        sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to
                        facilitate the transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than
                        documentation of the language itself. Debate around the monastic sign-language developed in the
                        Middle Ages has come to regard it as a gestural system rather than a true sign language.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earliest records of contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples of
                        the Gulf Coast region in what is now Texas and northern Mexico note a fully formed sign language
                        already in use by the time of the Europeans' arrival there. These records include the
                        accounts of Cabeza de Vaca in 1527 and Coronado in 1541.
                        Spanish monk Pedro Ponce de León (1520–1584) developed the first manual alphabet. This
                        alphabet was based, in whole or in part, on the simple hand gestures used by monks living in
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1620, Juan Pablo Bonet published Reducción de las letras y arte para
                        enseñar a hablar a los mudos ('Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak')
                        in Madrid. It is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics, setting
                        out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such
                        as secret communication, public speaking, or communication by or with deaf people. In
                        1648, John Bulwer described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual
                        alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily,
                        even in the dark through the use of tactile signing.</p>
                    
                    <img src="img/history.jpg" alt="Chirogram from Chirologia, 1644" width="350" >
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1680, George Dalgarno published Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans
                        tutor, in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological"
                        alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of
                        the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time; some have
                        speculated that they can be traced to early Ogham manual alphabets.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vowels of this alphabet have survived in the modern alphabets used in
                        British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. The earliest known printed pictures
                        of consonants of the modern two-handed alphabet appeared in 1698 with Digiti Lingua (Latin for
                        Language [or Tongue] of the Finger), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to
                        speak. He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence
                        and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier
                        alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of
                        26 handshapes depicted.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles de La Fin published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system
                        where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels
                        were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems. He described such codes
                        for both English and Latin.
                        By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form. Descendants of
                        this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in the former
                        British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the
                        republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean,
                        Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States. During the Polygar Wars against the British,
                        Veeran Sundaralingam communicated with Veerapandiya Kattabomman's mute younger brother,
                        Oomaithurai, by using their own sign language.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frenchman Charles-Michel de l'Épée published his manual alphabet in the 18th
                        century, which has survived largely unchanged in France and North America until the present
                        time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; Laurent Clerc
                        was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with Thomas Hopkins
                        Gallaudet to found the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.
                        Gallaudet's son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington,
                        D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called Gallaudet University, it
                        is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken
                        languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is
                        complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, although
                        Australia, English Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. all have English as their dominant
                        language, American Sign Language (ASL), derived from French Sign Language, is the main sign
                        language used in the U.S. and English Canada, whereas the other three countries use varieties of
                        British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language, unrelated to ASL. Similarly, the sign
                        languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in
                        each country, and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign
                        language that is used in any other Spanish-speaking country. Variations also arise within a
                        'national' sign language which do not necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the
                        national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of
                        residential schools for the deaf.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Sign, formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international
                        deaf events such as the Deaflympics and meetings of the World Federation of the Deaf. While
                        recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a pidgin, they conclude that it is
                        more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language. While
                        the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as Gestuno,
                        International Sign Pidgin or International Gesture (IG). International Sign is a term
                        used by the World Federation of the Deaf and other international organisations.</p>
