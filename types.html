                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although ASL has the same alphabet as English, ASL is not a subset of the
                        English
                        language. American
                        Sign Language was created independently and it has its own linguistic structure. Signs are also
                        not expressed in the same order as words are in English. This is due to the unique grammar and
                        visual nature of the sign language. ASL is used by roughly half a million people in the USA.</p>

                        is the first or preferred language among the deaf community in the UK.People who are not deaf
                        may also use BSL, as hearing relatives of deaf people, sign language interpreters or as a result
                        of other contact with the British Deaf community. The language makes use of space and involves
                        movement of the hands, body, face, and head.Unlike ASL, these alphabets use two hands, instead
                        of one.</p>

                                would be similar, but they are actually two completely different languages. Only about
                                30% of the signs are the same, even though they are based on the same spoken language.

                                the UK, you should learn BSL, and if you live in the US or in the English-speaking
                                regions of Canada, you should go for ASL.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australian Sign Language (ASL) is also known as Auslan. Auslan is the majority
                        sign language of the Australian Deaf community.Auslan is related to British Sign Language (BSL)
                        and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL); the three have descended from the same parent language,
                        and together comprise the BANZSL language family. Auslan has also been influenced by Irish Sign
                        Language (ISL) and more recently has borrowed signs from American Sign Language (ASL). </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with other sign languages, Auslan's grammar and vocabulary is quite
                        different from English. Its origin cannot be attributed to any individual; rather, it is a
                        natural language that emerged spontaneously and has changed over time.</p>

                            <p>Indian Sign Language (ISL) is used in the deaf community all over India. But ISL is not used in deaf schools to teach deaf children. Teacher training programs do not orient teachers towards teaching methods that use ISL. There is no teaching material that incorporates sign language.

                            <p>Each country has its own Sign Language, just like any other verbal language to communicate. India has Indian Sign Language, it uses both hands to create a Sign (word/expression). Many people think that its just making some random facial expression and throwing hands in the air, which absolutely is not the case.
